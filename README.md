Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to gain insights and patterns that can help businesses improve customer retention. We use a customer churn dataset to clean, explore, and visualize the data, and uncover trends related to customer behavior, such as their age, spending habits, support calls, and more.

What We Did
Data Import and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explored the data to understand its structure and initial content.
Data Cleaning:

Removed rows with missing values (null values).
Dropped irrelevant columns that weren't useful for the analysis.
Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed key customer attributes such as age, gender, tenure, and total spend.
Examined how these attributes relate to customer churn.
Created new columns to categorize customers, making the analysis easier to understand.
Visualization:

Generated various visualizations like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to better understand the data and relationships.
Plots included:
Total Spend Distribution
Churn Rate by Total Spend Group
Churn Rate by Tenure, Age, and Gender
Support Calls and Churn
Exported Cleaned Data:

After cleaning and processing, exported the final dataset to a CSV file for use in further analysis or machine learning models.

Future Work
Create machine learning models to predict churn based on customer behavior.
Improve feature engineering for better predictions.
